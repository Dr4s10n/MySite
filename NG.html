<br>let's look at the top 11 Nintendo games of 2017.

<!--Number 11-->
<p style="color:blue;font-size:200%">Number 11</p>

	<img src="FEE.jpg">
	<br><a style="font-Size:200%">Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadow of Valentia</a>
	<br>Shadows of Valentia is, much like it's brethren, a tactical rpg, and also a remake of the
	<br>Japan exclusive Fire Emblem game: "Fire Emblem Gaiden" &#40「ファイアーエムブレム外伝」, "Fire Emblem Side-story"&#41
	
<!--Number 10-->
<p style="color:purple;font-size:200%">Number 10</p>

	<img src="Meatred.jpg" height="200" width="320">
	<br><a style="font-Size:200%">Metroid: Samus Returns</a>
	<br>Metroid: Samus Returns is, much like its predecessors, a "Metroidvania", a game which uses
	<br>mechanics similar to those of Metroid and Castlevania games. This means that you can explore
	<br>the world of Metroid like the older games.

<!--Number 9-->
<p style="color:orange;font-size:200%">Number 9</p>

	<img src="po.jpg">
	<br><a style="font-Size:200%">Pokémon Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon</a>
	<br>Pokémon Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon focus on your fearless child protagonist as you adventure through the magical
	<br>world of Pokémon. Along the way, you fight team skull and the ultra beasts, on your journey to become a Pokémon Master.

<!--Number 8-->
<p style="color:lime;font-size:200%">Number 8</p>

	<img src="Arms.jpg">
	<br><a style="font-Size:200%">ARMS</a>
	<br>Arms, unsurprisingly, is a fighting game about using arms for long-ranged punches.
	<br>You can even switch your hands out for: boomerangs, missiles, shurikens, and even a mechanical bird.

<!--Number 7-->
<p style="color:hotpink;font-size:200%">Number 7</p>

	<img src="FEW.jpg">
	<br><a style="font-Size:200%">Fire Emblem Warriors</a>
	<br>Fire Emblem Warriors, much like Hyrule Warriors, is a combination between Dynasty Warriors and Fire Emblem.
	<br>It's a Hack & Slash game, unlike its tactical RPG roots. 

<!--Number 6-->
<p style="color:yellow;font-size:200%">Number 6</p>
	
	<img src="download.jpg">
	<br><a style="font-Size:200%">Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle</a>
	<br>Despite the glaring issue of the Rabbids, "Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle" is a surprisingly fun and enjoyable game. The game is
	<br>a tactical, turn-based role-playing game; much like Xcom. However, unlike Xcom, you play as an assortment of 
	<br>Mario and Rabbids related characters to fight the antagonists of said franchises. A strange combination, but it works

	
<!--Number 5-->
<p style="color:navy;font-size:200%">Number 5</p>

	<img src="MK8D.jpg">
	<br><a style="font-Size:200%">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>
	<br>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is a follow-up to Mario Kart 8 for the Nintendo Wii U and unlike the Wii U, doesn't contain DLC.
	<br>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has every character from Mario Kart 8 including the DLC.
	

<!--Number 4-->
<p style="color:navy;font-size:200%">Number 4</p>

	<img src="Xen2n.jpg">
	<br><a style="font-Size:200%">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a>
	<br>Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is a sequel to Xenoblade Chronicles. It's an RPG featuring Rex, the main character,
	<br>who uses the Monado, a laser sword.
	
<!--Number 3-->
<p style="color:chocolate;font-size:200%">Number 3</p>

	<img src="Splett2n.jpg">
	<br><a style="font-Size:200%">Splatoon 2</a>
	<br>Splatoon 2 is the sequel to Splatoon. Splatoon 2 is a shooting game with squids and ink.
	<br>Unconventionally, Splatoon 2 is actually a turf wars game; in which you fight to get the most land inked
	<br>in your colour.
	
<!--Number 2-->
<p style="color:silver;font-size:200%">Number 2</p>

	<img src="BreathOfTheWeath.jpg">
	<br><a style="font-Size:200%">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>
	<br>The Legend of Zelda series usually features a new incarnation of link in his quest to defeat Ganondorf, the evil gerudo
	<br>warlock. But Breath of the Wild instead has link, who has been in a 100 year slumber, who awakes to a Hyrule destroyed by
	<br>Calamity Ganon.
