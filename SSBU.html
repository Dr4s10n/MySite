		Super Smash Bros Ultimate or SSBU is one of the biggest releases of this year, so what better
		<br>way to celebrate than with a review. SSBU is a new game so this will not talk or contain content or spoilers
		<br>on the World of Light.
		<br>
		<br>The game has a total of 73 characters with more on the way in the form of DLC.
		<br>The game does have online play however many players have gone on record to say
		<br>it has one of the worst online matchmaking services.
		<br>"Super Smash Bros Ultimate really is something special, man.
		<br>In what other game can you have a 4 man match where Cloud, Joker, Mario and Sonic face off, with pokeballs
		<br>and assist trophies going off left and right, despite those 4 players all searched for 1v1 no items. 
		<br>Amazing" - TSM Leffen
